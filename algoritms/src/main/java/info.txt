Algoritm vs Program

Algorithm -> steps to solve a computational complex problem
-> written at design time
-> domain knowledge is needed
-> hardware / software / language independent
-> Analyze the algorithm

Programs
-> written as implementation
-> by programmers
-> Hardware/software and OS dependent

Ex : Complexity log(n)

for(i=1 ; p <=n ; i++){
p = p+ i ;
}

1 < log(n) < sqrt(n) < n < n.log(n) < n^2 < n^3 ... 2^n < 3^n

Asymptotic Notations
    -> O = Big O notation - upper bound
    -> big omega  - lower bound
    -> Theta - average bound

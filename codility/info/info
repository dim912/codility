Optimization Problems are solved by

1) Greedy -> divisable knapsack problam
2) Dynamic programing
3) Branch and Bounce


Greedy method applications

1) Hoffman cording


Minimum cost Spanning Tree (number of Edeges = number of Vertices -1 )

two algorithems
1. Prims algorithem -> (start with lowest cost edge, then selected smallest connected edges) - works only with connected graphs
2. Kruskals metohd -> (always select the minimum. So that no cycle is formed) - n^2 - works with non connection grapsh too


MinHeap -> data structure which gives the minimum value - timecomplextiy = n log (n)



Dijkstra Algorithem -> For single soruce shortest parth problam

means -> start vertext is given
find the minimum cost to some other away given

 * follow relaxation method
